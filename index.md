title: Welcome to my research study about learning! 



## A bit background about me and this project

Hi, my name is Yiqiong Yang, a Chinese girl on my way of a tough PhD journey at the University of Cambridge，major in Psychology and Education. I obtained a bachelor degre in psychology and then become specilised in educational psychology as I think learning how do we learn is fun. 

Learning is an amazing phenomenon in both human beings and animals. We may think it just comes so natrually to us, but actually there are lots of steps involved that worth to take a closer look, such as how do we reason a simple math problem, make decisions in a multiple choice and how do we aware of our judgement in different contexts. 

For me, I am in particular curious about how do we respond to tasks when rules changed. Do we use the same set of strategy to do different tasks? Do we stay alert in boredness? So, if you are willing to help me with answering these questions, this page has almost everything you need to know before continuing :)
 

## How does this experiment work?

This research project has three components: a brief questionnaire, a computerised experiment and a self-report survey. All responses will be recorde anounymously. 

### Part 1 Questionnaire
The first think you will come acros is a really short questionnaire. It consists of a an information sheet about the project for you to read through, a consent form for you to sign/click, and an ID generator that gives you a unique ID, which you may need to write it down for later use. 

Estimate duration: 1min

### Part 2 Computerised experiment
You will be directed to an online research platform after you finish the initial questionnaire, and thi platform only works for PC or laptops. So please make sure you open the experiment link on an appropriate device. You will complete three tasks on this platform, and the task rules and instructions will be displayed before you start. 

Estimate duration: 25-30min

### Part 3 Self-report survey
You will be re-directed the survey platform and complete a short demographic questionnaire, and then a task related questionnaire that contains 20 items. You will need the ID number generated in part 1 here. This is because the survey data and the experimen data are stored sperately, which requires a matching ID to identify individuals' data. However, it does not mean that your data can be tracked by any mean as all data are saved anoumymously.  

Estimate duration: 3-5min
