# Hello, welcome to my research study about learning! 

## A bit background about me and this project

My name is Yiqiong Yang, a Chinese girl on my way of a tough PhD journey at the University of Cambridge，major in Psychology and Education. I obtained a bachelor degre in psychology and then become specilised in educational psychology as I think the application of cognitivev psychology in learning is fun. 

Learning is an amazing phenomenon in both human being and animals. It seems to happen natrually to us, but there are many specific cognitive processes involved in learning that worth investigating, such as how do we think, reason, make decisions and aware of our decisions in different contexts. 

I am in particular curious about how we respond to tasks when specific rules apply. If you would like to help me with this research project, this page has almost everything you need to know before continuing :)
